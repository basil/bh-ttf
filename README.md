# Luxi Fonts

<img src="./Luxi_Sans.png" width="250" height="300">

## Introduction

In 2001, Bigelow & Holmes contributed TrueType versions of the basic Luxi family to the X Consortium.
These original files are still available and can be freely downloaded, but they can be hard to find.
So I tracked them down and wrote a script to convert them into a new package of OTFs, TTFs, and webfonts.

## Build

```bash
$ ./build.sh
$ ls dist/*.zip
dist/LuxiMono.zip
dist/LuxiSans.zip
dist/LuxiSerif.zip
```
